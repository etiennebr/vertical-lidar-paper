  Tree species have different overall shapes, structures, and forest stand 
  dynamics. Light detection
  and ranging (LiDAR) can measure the three dimensional position of
  reflective material by sending laser pulses through the canopy. We examine the 
  influence of three forest stand attributes:
  species, crown closure, and age on the vertical distribution of aerial
  LiDAR returns of forested stands. We studied over five thousand regular,
  even-aged stands in Quebec (Canada) with five dominant species: balsam
  fir (*Abies balsamea* (L.) Mill.), paper birch (*Betula papyrifera*
  Marsh), black spruce (*Picea mariana* (Mill.) BSP), white spruce (*Picea glauca* 
  Moench) and aspen (*Populus tremuloides* Michx.). We modeled vertical distribution of LiDAR 
  returns against the three attributes using a novel nonparametric graphical test of significance.
  Results indicate that aspen stands had the
  most uniform vertical distribution of LiDAR returns; balsam fir and
  white birch distributions were similar and centered around 50% of the
  stand height; black spruce and white spruce vertical distributions were
  skewed below 30% of stand height ($p$<0.001). An increase in crown closure
  concentrated the vertical distribution of returns around 50% height. Increasing age
  gradually shifted the distribution higher in the stand until 50–70
  years, where it then plateaued and slowly declined at 90–120 years. The full model maximal R²
  was 0.47 around 10% of stand height. Results suggest that the stands
  vertical distributions of LiDAR returns depends on the three variables studied.
  This improved understanding can be used for stand-level species classification
  with LiDAR, and to improve our understanding of the evolution of the forest
  structure over changing conditions.

  Using LiDAR remote sensing to assess even-aged stands vertical distributions, we
  find that species, age, and crown closure drive up to 47% of the distribution.
  Increases in crown closure concentrate LiDAR returns around 50% of stand height,
  while age raises the vertical distributions until a plateau and ultimate decline
  at maturity. While these patterns are consistent across species, they are
  statistically distinct.

# Introduction

The distribution of vegetation material within canopies varies with tree
allometry and competition strategies, leading to variations in canopy
structure and ultimately in environmental conditions [@graser_etal20]
