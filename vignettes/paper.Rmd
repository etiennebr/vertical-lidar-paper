Key Message
===========

Using LiDAR technology to assess even-aged stands vertical foliage
distributions we find that species, age, and crown closure all drive
distribution variations. Age raises vertical profile distributions until
a plateau and ultimate decline at maturity, and increases in crown
closure concentrate LiDAR returns in more distinct layers. While these
patterns are consistent across species, they are statistically distinct.

Abstract
========

Different tree species have different overall shapes,
canopy structures and as such, forest stand dynamics. The distribution
of vegetative material through the stand affects the growing conditions
and use of resources by the trees. Lidar provides the ability to
describe distribution of material by sending laser pulses through the
canopy. In this paper we examine the influence of three forest stand
attributes: species, crown closure and age on the vertical distribution
of aerial lidar returns of forested stands. We studied over five
thousand regular, even-aged stands in Quebec (Canada) with five dominant
species: balsam fir (*Abies balsamea* (L.) Mill.), paper birch (*Betula
papyrifera* Marsh), black spruce (*Picea mariana* (Mill.) BSP), white
spruce (*Picea glauca* Moench) and aspen (*Populus tremuloides *Michx.).
We used a novel nonparametric graphical test of significance to compare
species, crown closure and age groups.

Results indicate that aspen stands had the most uniform vertical
distribution of lidar returns; balsam fir and white birch distributions
were very similar and centered around 50% of the stand normalized
height; black spruce and white spruce vertical distributions were
generally lower than other species. Age drove the relative vertical
movement for 50-70 years until a plateau and declined in some cases.
Crown closure concentrated the vertical distribution of returns in a
layer. Most of the interspecific variations happened between 20 and 80%
of normalized height, while crown closure and age variations mostly
affected the stands below 75% of height. These results highlight how
lidar can improve our understanding of large-scale stands dynamics and
could improve species classification.

Introduction
=========================

The distribution of vegetation material within canopies varies with tree
allometry and competition strategies, leading to variations in canopy
structure and ultimately in environmental conditions
[]{#anchor-4}(Purves et al. 2007; Thorpe et al. 2010; Pretzsch and
Dieler 2012)(@purves_etal07;@thorpe_etal10;@pretzsch_dieler12). 
Species‑specific canopy structures create different
microhabitats, light conditions and microclimates which in turn
influence rates at which stands sequester carbon. Species have different
carbon allocation strategies that evolve during the growth season
relative to above and below ground carbon allocation such as growing
fruit, deploying leaves or root access to nutrients and water
[]{#anchor-5}(De Pury and Farquhar 1997; Lacointe 2000; Stark et al.
2012). Biomass is a feedback loop: more biomass generally allows for
increased production of biomass. These growth and allocation strategies
vary by species resulting in archetypical tree morphologies that will
have predictable, although complex, reactions to growth conditions. This
results in the distinct species-specific tree shapes.

Traditionally, characterization of stand above-ground biomass vertical
distribution required either on-site estimation of biomass per vertical
layer using scaffolding, tree climbing, or destructive measurements that
are time-consuming and limited to small areas. Scaling these
observations to the landscape is very difficult using traditional
techniques []{#anchor-6}(MacArthur and Horn 1969; Aber 1979; Bassow and
Bazzaz 1997; Tackenberg 2007).

Forest remote sensing
---------------------------

The increasing availability of data collected remotely from airborne,
spaceborne and terrestrial sensors has improved our understanding of the
forest dynamics []{#anchor-7}(Wulder et al. 2012; White et al. 2013;
Beland et al. 2019). Among these sensors, light detection and ranging
(lidar) has the ability to penetrate the canopy and provide information
on the spatial location of reflective material. Lidar is increasingly
used to perform both extensive and highly detailed imaging of the
forest. It use a laser which location and orientation are precisely
known to record a 3D scene. When penetrating the canopy, a lidar pulse
hits vegetative material which is reflected back to the sensor and
recorded. Lidar can be used from the ground, and from an aircraft to
provide different perspectives on the forest. Terrestrial lidar provides
highly detailed structural information of individual trees, but its
extent is limited to hundreds of meters []{#anchor-8}(Beland et al.
2019; Crespo-Peremarch et al. 2020). Airborne lidar on the other hand,
is generally used for extensive landscape measurements that are
generally less detailed than terrestrial lidar.

Airborne lidar has been used to characterize vertical canopy structure,
crown shape, and ecosystem's above-ground biomass
[]{#anchor-9}(Ellsworth and Reich 1993; Harding et al. 2001; Lefsky et
al. 2002; Parker et al. 2004; Coops et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2012; Cao
et al. 2014; Papa et al. 2020), to identify tree species
[]{#anchor-10}(Heinzel and Koch 2011, 2012; Vaughn et al. 2012; Hovi et
al. 2016; Fassnacht et al. 2016; Budei et al. 2018; Axelsson et al.
2018; Fedrigo et al. 2018), and to study stand characteristics such as
age, crown closure and basal area []{#anchor-11}(Korhonen et al. 2011;
White et al. 2013; Racine et al. 2014). Airborne lidar is an important
tool to quantify biomass and offers many opportunities to explore
large-scale phenomena that could only be observed on the field, such as
large-scale habitat characterization (Vierling et al. 2008, 2010; Seavy
et al. 20[]{#anchor-12}09).

One of the limitations of the conventional small footprint lidar sensors
is its inability to distinguish differences in foliage condition or
species spectral variations because it lacks spectral information
commonly used to classify species (such as variations in color or near
infrared). In response, the most common strategy to distinguish species
with lidar has been to rely on individual tree shapes and texture
[]{#anchor-13}(Holmgren and Persson 2004; Kim et al. 2011; Fassnacht et
al. 2016), add spectral information by supplementing it with imagery and
more recently using a multispectral lidar []{#anchor-14}(Budei et al.
2018; Budei and St-Onge 2018).

Most species classification studies using aerial lidar have focused on
individual tree-crown species identification. Tree crown delineation
requires a high number of lidar returns and very accurate registration
of ground observations []{#anchor-15}(Ørka et al. 2009; Muss et al.
2011). Furthermore, using such a small observation area, the number of
lidar returns decreases and the vertical distribution increasingly
becomes a collection of random deviates and loses the general
distribution shape. For that reason, accuracy in species identification
is improved by increasing point density up to 10 pt/m²
[]{#anchor-16}(Fassnacht et al. 2016).

Aerial lidar is also used in area-based approaches []{#anchor-17}(see
e.g. White et al. 2013 for a complete description). This approach
generally uses a stand or a pixel on which lidar returns are aggregated
and from which predictors are derived and then used in a model to
predict forest attributes. Lidar metrics often derive predictors from
the vertical distribution of lidar returns: the number or lidar returns
per height slice. The vertical distribution of lidar returns is often
presented as quantiles, projections of quantiles (such as principal
component analysis), or parametric functions (such as a Fourrier, beta
or Weibull function), which are used to predict stand attributes
[]{#anchor-18}(Magnussen et al. 1999; Maltamo et al. 2005; Mehtätalo
2006; Coops et al. 2007; Riggins et al. 2009; Falkowski et al. 2009;
Racine et al. 2014; Palace et al. 2015). The area-based method can be
effective with point density as low as 1 pt/m², which reduces cost and
processing compared to tree-crown approaches []{#anchor-19}(White et al.
2013).

This idea builds on other studies (Ørka et al. 2009) that e.g. found
that first and last returns were more dispersed in Birch (Betula spp.)
than in Norway spruc*e (Pice*a abies (L.) Karst.) crowns, which also had
a vertical distribution of first returns skewed toward the top of the
canopy,[]{#anchor-20}(Ørka et al. 2009)and that increased height
modified the overall return distribution.

Objectives
----------

In this paper, we combined ideas from the the tree-crown approach to
species identification, the vertical biomass distribution and the large
scale area-based method to compare species vertical lidar return
distribution at different ages and crown closure, which are both known
to affect the stand structure. We speculate that intraspecific
variations of lidar distribution patterns are smaller than interspecific
variations after accounting for stand crown closure and age.

[]{#anchor-21}Method
====================

Study area
----------

The study was conducted in Matane Wildlife Reserve (Quebec, Canada,
48°41’N, -66°58’E) covering 1600 km² (Figure 1). The Reserve is a mixed
forest mostly dominated by balsam fir (*Abies balsamea* (L.) Mill.),
paper birch (*Betula papyrifera* Marsh) and black spruce (*Picea
mariana* (Mill.) BSP), but other species are present such as white
spruce (*Picea glauca* Moench), aspen (*Populus tremuloides *Michx.),
norway spruce (*Picea abies* (L.) Karst.), jack pine (*Pinus banksiana*
Lamb.) and other noncommercial deciduous species. Most of the Reserve is
under active commercial logging, which was documented since 1962: 27% of
the area had been harvested (mostly total harvesting) of which half of
the areas had been replanted. Other natural origins (e.g. windthrow,
insect epidemic, fire) accounted for 2% of the territory and the
remaining 72% of the territory had an undocumented origin. Having
documented origin of stands helped the photo-interpreters to calibrate
their observations.

Data
----

Airborne imagery and lidar were acquired during the summer of 2007. All
data were collected by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources as part
of their decennial forest mapping program. Lidar survey had a nominal
point density of 3 points/m² with an Optech ALTM 2050 sensor recording
first and last returns at 40kHz, flown at 1200 m above ground, with a
flight overlap of 30% and maximal scan angle of 15° from nadir with a
nominal footprint diameter of 25 cm.

Airborne photography was acquired with a Leica ADS-40 pushbroom camera
at 0.2 and 0.5 m resolution for panchromatic and near-infrared, green
and blue bands (NIR, G, B respectively centered on 860, 560 and 460 nm);
side overlap was 40% to ensure complete coverage of the area. This
imagery was interpreted into stands following provincial guidelines
[]{#anchor-22}(MRNQ 2007) by expert photo-interpreters. Using digital
stereopsis (virtual 3D vision from stereo images) from the forward and
nadir-facing ADS-40 sensor, the expert photo-interpreter discriminate
many species by integrating information on landscape position, crown
shapes, texture and color. Every photo was segmented into homogenous
stands using species, crown closure, height and geomorphic criteria.
Each stand was classified regarding species composition, crown closure,
age, height and other ecological parameters using a combination of
photography, ground-control points and historical data as reference.
Stand age is estimated using ground control plots where trees were
cored, this information is then combined with available archives, height
and ecology to judge age from aerial photography \[make sure the
uncertainty of age is clear\]. Forest age is interpreted in 7 broad age
classes: (10 \[0-20\], 30 \[21-40\], 50 \[41-60\], 70 \[61-80\], 90
\[81-100\], 120 \[101, ∞\[, and irregular). Crown closure is visually
estimated by comparing the proportion of open ground with the space
occupied by the mature tree crowns. It is estimated in 9 classes: 10
\[5-14\], 20 \[15-24\], 30 \[25-34\], 40 \[35-44\], 50 \[45-54\], 60
\[55-64\], 70 \[65-74\], 80 \[75-84\], and 90 \[85-100\]. Finally, the
interpretation of the species rely on the ground-control points and the
ecological knowledge of the photo-interpreter. We used this forest map
as our reference data for species, crown closure and a[]{#anchor-23}ge.

[]{#anchor-26}Processing
------------------------

We focused our analysis on even-aged stands larger than 4 ha with
clearly dominant species representing at least 50% of the stand cover.
Even-aged stands are less complex to analyze from a vertical structure
point of view than irregular stands, which made them appropriate for our
analysis. We excluded stands with an average lidar sampling rates below
2 pt/m² to ensure sufficient number of lidar returns. From these stands,
we kept only those with a dominant species that had at least 100
observations (stands): aspen, balsam fir, black spruce, paper birch and
white spruce. From 22 365 segmented stands of the original forest map,
we reduced our dataset to 5 428 stands representing 35% of the study
area (Figure 1). Stand area distribution was similar for every selected
species (median 9 ha, minimum 4 ha, maximum 137 ha).

We subtracted the ground elevation from the absolute point elevation to
compute the vertical distribution of lidar return for every stand (Muss
et al. 2[]{#anchor-27}011). Vertical distribution is an histogram of
lidar returns height sliced in 40 horizontal sections relative to their
highest returned point. The slices were defined relative to maximal
height (Harding et al. 2001; Coops et al. 2[]{#anchor-28}007) to allow
comparison across stands of different heights. We then divided each
slice count by the total number of points of the stand so each stand
vertical distribution summed to one to allow comparisons between stands
of inconsistent shapes, areas and sampling intensities.

[]{#anchor-29}Analysis
----------------------

We used a novel method that builds on the functional data analysis field
[]{#anchor-30}(Ramsay and Silverman 2005) to compare the complete
verticla distribution of lidar returns. Most studies of species
classification have focused on the accuracy of classifiers and the value
of predictors for classification, often using dimension reduction to
decrease the number of predictors such as linear discriminant analysis
or principal component analysis []{#anchor-31}(Koenig and Höfle 2016;
Räty et al. 2016; Axelsson et al. 2018). However, dimension reduction
decreases the ability to understand the effect of a given variable and
interpret the results of the model.

To compare inter- and intraspecific lidar return distribution variations
and the confounding variables, we used a nonparametric graphical test of
significance (Myllymäki and Mrkvička 2019; Mrkvička et al.
[]{#anchor-32}2019). We modeled vertical distributions of lidar returns
as a function of dominant species, crown closure and age using the
general linear model
$$d_i(h) = \beta_0(h)+\beta_{sp}(h)\cdot Species + \beta_{cc}(h) \cdot CC +
\beta_{age}(h) \cdot Age + \varepsilon_i(h)$$ [eq .1]{#anchor-eq1}
Where $d_i$ contains the lidar density distribution at scaled height $h$
(represented by the vertical distribution histogram) for observation $i$, and
$\beta$ is the estimated parameter for each coefficient, $CC$ is crown closure,
$sp$ is species, and $\varepsilon(h)$ are error terms with mean zero and finite
variance $\sigma^2$.

We studied the effect of each variable after accounting for the other
confounding variables (also called the nuisance factors by Freedman and
Lane []{#anchor-33}(1983)). We successively tested the three null
hypotheses $\beta_{sp}(h) = 0$, $\beta_{cc}(h) = 0$, $\beta_{age}(h) = 0$ 
for each $h$.
The corresponding three null models were obtained by
removing the variable under study from the full model (eq. 1),
$$d_i(h) = \beta_0(h)+ \beta_{cc}(h) \cdot CC +
\beta_{age}(h) \cdot Age+ \varepsilon_i(h)$$ [eq .2]{#anchor-eq2}, 
$$d_i(h) = \beta_0(h) + \beta_{sp}(h) \cdot Species +
\beta_{age}(h) \cdot Age+ \varepsilon_i(h)$$ [eq .3]{#anchor-eq3}, and
$$d_i(h) = \beta_0(h)+\beta_{sp}(h)\cdot Species + \beta_{cc}(h) \cdot CC+ 
\varepsilon_i(h)$$ [eq .4]{#anchor-eq4}. 
The test relies on two procedures: 1) Freedman-Lane algorithm to permute
the residuals of the null model and create the reference distribution of
the coefficients under the null hypothesis, and 2) the *global extreme
rank length envelope test* to build a null global envelope in which our
null hypothesis (no differences between distributions) is accepted
[]{#anchor-34}(Myllymäki et al. 2017). There was no evidence against the
null hypothesis if the test vector calculated from the data was
completely contained in the null envelope, but if the test vector leaved
the envelope at any point, the null hypothesis was rejected. We used
2999 random permutations to estimate the p-value (with a Bonferroni
adjusted $\alpha = 0.05/3$, accounting for the three models in equation 2-4) and
build the 95% global envelopes for the nonparametric graphical test of
significance (Myllymäki and Mrkvička []{#anchor-35}2019). We checked the
data for heterogeneity and normality (Winkler et al. 2014), and the rank
envelope F-type test (Mrkvicka et al. 2020) indicated heterogeneity of
variance in samples. Followig []{#anchor-36}(Mrkvicka et al. 2020), we
transformed the data []{#anchor-37}by scaling groups ($j$)
according to their variance dispersion. The initial $d_{i,j}$
function was transformed into $S_{i,j}$ function, 
$$S_{i,j}(h) = {d_{i,j}(h) - \bar{d_j}(r) \over\sqrt{Var(d_j(h))}} \cdot
\sqrt{Var(d(h))} + \bar{d_j}(h)$$ [eq. 5]{#anchor-eq5}
where the group sample mean $\bar{d_j}(h)$ and
global variance $Var(d(h))$ are used to correct for unequal variance among groups.

Our experiments with simulated data showed that the application of the
transformation for all groups at once (by combining all group levels)
generally removed heterogeneity of the variance, but it required to have
sufficient observations in all categories, which was not the case of our
data. We instead relied on successive application of the transformation
(eq. 5) by group. In this case, we found that the order in which the
transformation is applied is important because it can reintroduce
significant heterogeneity of variance. We settled on the successive
transformation by crown closure, age and species which provided the best
results and reduced heterogeneity, but did not completely removed it.
Our simulations showed that heterogeneity could remain significant after
successive transformations without affecting the results, especially for
large dataset (i.e. 5000 observations) while the F-type test would not
detect heterogeneity in a smaller random sample of 200 observations,
which made the remaining heterogeneity of variance acceptable. We also
simulated the effect of class imbalance in species, age and crown
closure, which did not affect our results, consistently with ordinary
least square regression in general on which the graphical test of
significance are based.

We used the parameter differences (contrasts) as the test vector by
using the left-out $\beta$ in equation 2 to 4. We also summarized the differences
by species, crown closure and age by the sum of the differences per
class (sum of absolute differences for species), and the absolute sum of
these differences per variable to identify the areas of the lidar return
distribution that presented the most differences. We performed the
analysis using R 3.6.3 (R Core Team []{#anchor-38}[]{#anchor-39}2020),
the GET package (Myllymäki and Mrkvička 2019; Mrkvička et al.
[]{#anchor-40}2019), and Lastools (Isenburg []{#anchor-41}2012) to
correct and extract the lidar data.

[]{#anchor-42}Results
=====================

The contrasts from the nonparametric graphical test of significance
confirm that we can reject the null hypothesis: the differences between
most species, after accounting for age and crown closure, were
significantly different (p-value &lt; 0.001) (figure 2). The differences
between balsam fir and paper birch were significant, however very small,
localised at 65-70% and below 12% of height. White spruce and black
spruce also had small localised differences at 22-30% and 5-8%. Some
differences were more important: black and white spruces had the lowest
distribution of lidar returns when compared to balsam fir and paper
birch. Black spruce had less returns between 38-62% (40-57% for paper
birch), while it had more below 28% of height (30% for paper birch).
Aspen’s vertical distribution of lidar return had a significantly
distinctive shape when compared to every other species: it did not
display an proeminent peak, which made the distribution more uniform
than other species, except for the area between 57-60% of height for all
species, and 8-18% for balsam fir and paper birch.

Increase in crown closure were associated to a decrease in density of
lidar returns below 33% of height, while density of lidar returns above
38% increased (figure 3). The largest effect was concentrated around the
middle height (50%), while the lower layer (&lt;3% of height) had the
smallest effect. Figure 4 displays the effect of crown closure on each
species’ vertical distribution of lidar returns.

The effect of increasing age gradually shifted the distribution higher
in the stand up to 70 years of age, when it seemed to reach a plateau.
Most differences for stand between 10 and 70 years of age were
significant (p&lt;0.001), while most of significant differences for
stands of 90 and 120 years of age were of smaller magnitude and below
69% and 44% respecively. The gradual shift of the distribution toward
the top of the stand as age increases is reflected by the younger stands
(10, 30 yr) with an abundance of lower returns below 28% and 41%,
respectively, and fewer higher returns (above 33% and 49% of height,
respectively). The effect is inversed in mature stands of 50 and 70
years, where there is a positive effect between 38-97% of height
(44-100% for 70 yr), and a negative effect below 31% of height (38% for
70 yr). Like mature stands, older stand of 90 and 120 years of age also
had a postive effect in the superior part of the stand, although it was
lower than mature stands (90 yr: 38-68%; 120 yr: 33-44%) and of smaller
magnitude.The inferior parts of old stands had a negative effect below
28 and 23% of height for 90 and 120 years of age, respectively. Overall,
the differences in vertical distribution of lidar return gradually
decreased as the age increased. For example, changes in the distribution
between 10 and 50 years were larger than differences between 50 and 120
years (figure 7).

[]{#anchor-43}Discussion
========================

The objective of our study was to test if intraspecific lidar returns
distributions were smaller than interspecific differences after
accounting for stand crown closure and age. We found that even-aged
stands exhibit species-specific lidar return distribution patterns that
evolve predictably with crown closure and age. We observed that balsam
fir and paper birch had a more symmetrical vertical distribution of
lidar returns centered around 50% stand height. White spruce and black
spruce had a distribution of lidar returns that was generally skewed
toward the lower part of the stand. Aspen displayed a more even
distribution of lidar returns with a higher proportion of returns higher
in the stand than other species.

While individual trees are all plastic and opportunistic, adapting to
specific light and environmental conditions[]{#anchor-44}, we found that
stands of a species exhibited similar characteristics that distinguished
them from other species. This is consistent with previous field plot
observations conducted on a different scale with different measurement
methods []{#anchor-45}(Purves et al. 2007). However, we expected clearer
patterns along a shade-tolerance gradient or conifer versus deciduous;
we found that patterns of paper birch were more similar to balsam fir
than aspen, another shade-intolerant deciduous, while balsam fir is a
shade-tolerant conifer. This could also be the result of frequent
association between balsam fir and paper birch, and the effect of the
unbalanced stand samples which had unequal number of age and crown
closure classes, although our tests accounted for this potential effect.

Most species differences between vertical lidar distributions occurred
between 20 - 80% of height. The higher sections of the stand often
displayed very little differences in distributions while the lower
portion was highly variable which made the two areas seem less
discriminant, especially for species. Biotic and abiotic factors could
be added to the model to enhance our understanding of these variations.

Increased crown closure was associated to a concentration of the
vertical distribution of lidar returns. Complementarily, stands with a
lower crown closure presented a vertical distribution of lidar returns
that was more dispersed and skewed toward the ground. Increased age
shifted the peak higher in the stand up to 50-70 years and then
plateaued or declined at 90-120 yr.

These dominant variations were mostly similar across species, but the
overall species mean distribution created a distinctive pattern for each
species studied. We could not quantify the relative contribution of the
three variables under study (species, crown closure and age), but they
were all significant (p-value &lt; 0.001).

Interestingly, the graphical test of significance rejected the
hypothesis that the distribution of lidar returns were similar, and also
identified the areas responsible for the rejection. We think that this
method could complement and sometimes replace other methods of analysis
of the vertical distribution of lidar returns, such as principal
component analysis or linear discriminant analysis.

Limitations
-----------

The median stand area was 9 ha, a large area compared to other
area-based approaches, which allowed the aggregation lidar returns to
identify specific patterns. Stands are by design the most homogeneous
unit of the forest landscape, and vertical lidar distributions are more
reliable after a sufficient number of aggregated returns are grouped,
but the exact optimal area to observe these patterns would require
additional research.

The non-parametric graphical test of significance that we used is more
liberal than other methods []{#anchor-46}(Mrkvička et al. 2019). But we
believe that the advantage of the graphical interpretation, especially
the identification of the exact domain of rejection, allowed for a
better interpretation than the global rejection of the null hypothesis
despite the higher risk rejection of the null hypothesis.

Additional evidence is needed to establish if these observations are
circumstantial to our study area and our

### Future outlook

We found differences in the distributions of lidar returns of five tree
species. The graphical test of significance allowed an interpretation of
the vertical distribution of lidar returns and link them to specific
mechanisms, which could be used to improve our understanding of stand
structure evolution and species classification with lidar.

In a review of remote sensing tree species classification, Fassnacht et
al. []{#anchor-47}(2016) noted that studies pursued the optimization of
classification accuracy, and provided little analysis of the causal
understanding of species discrimination. Although we didn’t perform
species classification, we think that our results show that it is
possible to interpret the differences between complex predictors and
that accounting for confounding factors and using larger areas could
help perform lidar-only species classification. \[see other discussion
coops 2020\]

The generalization of our method to other areas and species still
remains to be studied. This technique can provide additional insights
compared to the interpretation of classification results and selected
features.

\[Interaction between age and crown closure\]

\[Results could be used to improve aerial photo-interpretation\]

\[Expand T-lidar observations\]

 airborne lidar could improve our understanding of large-scale stand
structure by not only providing empirical model, but also a large-scale
functional explanation of the dynamics.

\[notes: In a review of remote sensing tree species classification,
Fassnacht et al. []{#anchor-48}(2016) noted that studies pursued the
optimization of classification accuracy, and provided little analysis of
the causal understanding of species discrimination. However (Ørka et al.
2009) found that first and last returns were more concentrated in Norway
spruc*e (Pice*a abies (L.) Karst.) than Birch (*Betula *spp.) crowns
which also had a lower distribution of first returns []{#anchor-49}(Ørka
et al. 2009)nd increased height modified the overall return
distribution.\]

[]{#anchor-50}Conclusion
========================

We used light detection and ranging (lidar) to compare return
distribution of regular stands dominated by five species: balsam fir,
paper birch, aspen, white and black spruce. We found that species
feature distinctive vertical lidar distributions that concentrate with
crown closure and rise with age. By using large-scale lidar survey we
could find ecosystems at multiple evolution stage to observe lidar
patterns variations that seemed related to documented biomass movement
within the stand.

We think our results improve the understanding of the interaction
between stand attributes and lidar and that this knowledge could be
integrated in empirical and functional models for stand attribute
predictions and species classification.

The functional data analysis method we used, which to our knowledge has
never been used in this way, allowed to visually compare across species
and identify the areas of variation in the lidar distribution. We
believe this method can facilitate the interpretation of lidar
distributions and broaden its usage.
